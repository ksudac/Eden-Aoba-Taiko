                We did it again....BEST BAND AWARD!!
                Our group participated in July 4th Parade in Danville, again this year. It was a nice day and hot though.  
                Members got there around 7 am and started to decorate our trailer. Everything went smooth….product of harmony, flexibility, and unity.
                I guess every member learned this from weekly practice. So we marched down 1.5 miles, pounding taiko all the way.
                Thanks for Gary who let us use his 18’ trailer and for Jeff building frames on it. Thus the trailer was long enough, everyone was able to be on board !!
                No one needed to walk in the high temperature like last year. We had a great fun and are honored to get the best band award in 2 years in a row.
                Good job, everyone!!! <a href="photos.shtml">Check out photos of this great parade is in the Gallery.</a>

              <span>I have received several pictures from Monica & Chris who moved to France. Her message is as followed:</span><br /><br />
              <span>They are settling down in the center of the city with the statue with Elephants, and live right next to it in the white building that is behind 
              Chris (in the photo by the fountain). There is a straight street that goes from the statue of the Elephants to the Castle (of the Dukes of Savoy),
              which is very nice and also has columns on both sides. That is what we see from our balcony. Also, photos of the church and of a plaza. The town
              (center) is old and has very nice buildings. The red flag with a white cross is the flag of Savoy - the region where we are - which was French or
              Italian a few times during history. Chambery is the capital of the region...if you are ever interested this place, check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambéry">wikipedia.</a>

          <span>What is Taiko</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>Taiko (太鼓?) means "drum" in Japanese. Outside Japan, the word is often used to refer to any of the various 
          Japanese drums (和太鼓, "wa-daiko", "Japanese drum", in Japanese) and to the relatively recent art-form of ensemble 
          taiko drumming. </span>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <br></br>
        
          <h2>
            <span>A Short History</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>
                Eden Aoba Taiko was formed in 1997 to promote the Japanese music art of Taiko drumming under the direction of Masa Fukuizumi. 
                The group started with 6 people and increased to 50 by the end of the year. Members' ages range from 6 year-old to more than 80. 
                We believe that Taiko is for everyone, no matter what your age.             
            </span>
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>  
            <span>
                Our Taiko philosophy is to have a fun drumming and enhance self-expression, self-esteem, and self-confidence. 
                It is also our goal to enrich disciplines such as respect, harmony, and unity through drumming with others.
            </span>
          </p>  
          <br></br>
          <p>
            <span>    
                Learning taiko takes a time. There are no short cuts or simply ways. It is very similar to life; ups and downs, bends and straights. It requires a patience.
                Taiko is a mental training with physical strength. So long as you practice, you will get better; and then comes fun.
