                The Japanese believe in the power of Gods as their protectors &amp; guides for their day-to-day lives. Kojiki, one of Japan’s oldest documents, 
                states that Japan itself was created by Gods. The most notable of the thousands of Gods are: God of Sea, God of Earth, God of Wind, God of Thunder, 
                God of Mountain, and God of Fire. The people of Japan respect, entertain, and harmonize with the Gods because they know and understand the power 
                of the Gods is infinite and simply great.

		          During the rise of Japan, fights broke out amongst the Gods. Disappointed in the fighting, Amaterasu hid behind a rock, hoping the world would stop fighting. 
		          Although the fighting stopped, without the sun, evil spirits started scaring people. The people created a plan to bring Amaterasu out from behind the rock; 
		          they believed if Amaterasu heard cheerful &amp; joyful noise, she would get curious and peek out to see what was going on and so they would get their Sun back.

	          Zoku is a Japanese term signifying a Group or Gathering. The original song is composed and performed by Kodo, who is one of the most important groups 
	          that promote Taiko within and outside of Japan. The group members spend a third of a year touring overseas, one third performing in Japan and one 
	          third preparing new material on the island of Sado. This version has been adapted for our group by our instructor, Masa Fukuizumi, and is our tribute 
	          to the work that Kodo does to promote Taiko around the world.

          	Soran Bushi is an old folk song that describes the life of fishermen from the island of Hokkaido, as they go to sea, throw fishing nets, 
          	harvest the catch and finally celebrate a good fishing day. The flags that signify the “Good Catch” are raised to let anxious families on the shore 
          	know that it’s time to enjoy the fruit of their hard work. Dancers perform alongside this traditional song played by Shinobue and the Taiko.
